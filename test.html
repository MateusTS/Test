    <h1>Bird Set Free</h1>
    <p>Clipped wings, I was a broken thing <br>
        Had a voice, had a voice but I could not sing <br>
        You would wind me down <br>
        I struggled on the ground, oh <br>
        So lost, the line had been crossed <br>
        Had a voice, had a voice but I could not talk <br>
        You held me down <br>
        I struggle to fly now, oh
    </p>
